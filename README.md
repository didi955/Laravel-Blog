[Laravel Blog](https://blog.dylan-lannuzel.fr) is a project for learning the Laravel framework based on Jeffrey Way's web application from the [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) series, [Laravel From Scratch](https://laravelfromscratch.com).
I have developed this application in parallel to this series.

## New features

At the end of the series, I decided to push the project further by implementing new features that were useful and made sense for this project.
Here are the major new features :

- Scheduled Posts
- Draft Post
- Customizable Profile (avatar & personal info)
- WYSIWYG HTML editor for the post's content
- Administration features (users & categories management)
- Multiple queued notifications & events
- Bookmarks system
- Some security system (password recovery & email verification)

### Further Ideas

- Messages & timezones user's localization
- Allow registered users to "follow" certain authors. When they publish a new post, an email should be delivered to all followers.
- Ban system

## Warning

I am aware that the development is not yet perfect and still has some bugs that may hinder the user's functional experience.
That's why the contribution is useful for me.
